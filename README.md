## Introduction

Language Classifications Menu is a simple CLI application that allows users to look up a database of languages and language families.
You can see which classification they belong to (such as Semitic, Germanic, Romance, etc.). You can look up how many total speakers
in the world of that language, and even whether that language is still spoken, or has gone extinct. You additionally have the ability
to make changes to the database as you see fit.

The core technologies of this application are <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3.8.13</a> and <a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/">SQLite3</a>. So if you wish to run this application on your machine, make sure
you have both installed on it first.
